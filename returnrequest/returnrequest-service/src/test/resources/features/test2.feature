Feature: Testcase ID 2
Tests the returnrequest Workflow Service using a REST client. Returnrequest service exists and is under test.
It helps to create a returnrequest and manages the state of the returnrequest as documented in states xml

Scenario: Create a new returnrequest
Given that "flowName" equals "return-request-flow"
And that "initialState" equals "REQUESTED"
When I POST a REST request to URL "/returnrequest" with payload
"""json
{
    "description": "Description"
}
"""
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.id" from response to "id"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "${initialState}"
And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" from response to "currentState"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.description" is "Description"

Scenario: Retrieve the returnrequest that just got created
When I GET a REST request to URL "/returnrequest/${id}"
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "${currentState}"


Scenario: Send the inspectReturn event to the returnrequest with comments
Given that "comment" equals "Comment for inspectReturn"
And that "event" equals "inspectReturn"
When I PATCH a REST request to URL "/returnrequest/${id}/${event}" with payload
"""json
{
    "comment": "${comment}"
}
"""
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "UNDER_REVIEW"
And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" from response to "finalState"

Scenario: Send the rejectReturn event to the returnrequest with comments
Given that "comment" equals "Comment for rejectReturn"
And that "event" equals "rejectReturn"
When I PATCH a REST request to URL "/returnrequest/${id}/${event}" with payload
"""json
{
    "comment": "${comment}"
}
"""
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "REJECTED"
And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" from response to "finalState"
